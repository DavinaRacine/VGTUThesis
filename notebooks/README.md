# 🧠 Lab 5 — End-to-End AI Demonstration Using Gemini API

## 🎯 Goal
In this lab, the Intelligent Repository Reliability Analyzer (IRRA) is implemented as a **fully operational AI system** in Google Colab using the **Gemini API**.  
The system demonstrates two modes of prompt-based reasoning:
- **Zero-shot** — The AI predicts reliability from new repository metrics without prior examples.  
- **Few-shot** — The AI learns from a known example to make more context-aware predictions.  

This work extends the prompt engineering design from **Lab 4**, located in `VGTUThesis/prompts/`, now implemented as an executable, end-to-end pipeline.

### 🧩 Process Flow
1. **Input Stage** – Repository metrics (X) provided as structured JSON.  
2. **Reasoning Stage** – Gemini interprets the formula and scale using prompt instructions.  
3. **Inference Stage** – The model calculates RRI and classifies reliability.  
4. **Output Stage** – Results displayed as tables and JSON outputs for integration or analysis.  

✅ Both zero-shot and few-shot runs demonstrate end-to-end AI reasoning — from data input to final prediction.

### Reflection

This laboratory work successfully implemented an end-to-end AI agent for repository reliability assessment using the Gemini API in Google Colab.  
The system processes raw repository metrics and computes reliability indices through structured prompt reasoning. The **zero-shot** approach shows the model’s ability to infer outcomes directly from instructions, while the **few-shot** approach enhances contextual understanding through a learned example.  

Gemini handled both structured numeric data and qualitative interpretation (labels like "Good" or "Excellent") effectively, producing explainable results. The prompt-based architecture proved lightweight, interpretable, and flexible for AI-assisted data analysis.  
Future improvements could include integrating automatic metric normalization, visual dashboards for reliability trends, and dataset-driven fine-tuning for even higher prediction consistency.
