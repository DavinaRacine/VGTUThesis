### ðŸ“‚ About This Folder

This folder contains example Excel files that were generated using prompts provided by ChatGPT to ChatGPT as part of my thesis work on **Development Project Quality Assessment using Event-Based Methods**.

Each file includes simulated data outputs for repository reliability analysis based on the following key metrics:
- **Review Rigor Score**
- **PR Merge Ratio**
- **Contributor Diversity Index**
- **Issue Resolution Rate**

These examples were created to demonstrate how AI-generated data can support process mining and reliability evaluation in software development research.
